//ST: 1. Data: you don't get in on tap

//ST: !

A naive vision of data would get that it's all fluid. Don't we talk about "data streams"?
Working with data would be as simple as opening a tap and "getting customer data", for instance.

//ST: !

//ST: !

Actually, data is more like a complex patchwork: many different pieces which must be stiched together - and this is hard.

//ST: !

//ST: !

Take customer data.

It is not a given. Instead, this is a design made of multiple primary data sources:

//ST: !

//ST: !

Take away: Data is fragmented by nature. It comes from different sources and presented in different formats.
*You* (the marketer in collaboration with data scientists) wrangle to __construct__ customer profiles by joining and assembling different sources of data into a meaningful synthesis.

//ST: !

(if you are interested, data scientists actually have whole books on the subject of wrangling with the mess of different data sources)

== 2. Sources of fragmentation
//ST: 2. Sources of fragmentation

//ST: !

==== a. Channels keep diversifying

//ST: !

Point of sale, print, TV, radio, outdoor posters, mobile apps, mobile sites, emails, SMS, APIs, social networks, search engines, e-commerce platforms, e-commerce websites, blogs, content channels, …

-> all these channels can provide relevant data.

//ST: !

==== b. Connections between these channels intensify and complexify

//ST: !

- Social TV is TV delivered with Internet services,

- User profiles created on one platform are imported on another

//ST: !

- Orders taken online can be picked up on a variety of point of sales

- Ads circulating through one channel replicate on other channels, ...

//ST: !

-> It is very complex to trace the "customer journey" on all these channels and to keep an updated view of a customer profile.

It is even more difficult to explore causality (which action on which channel caused which subsequent action by the user?)

//ST: !

==== c. Underlying technologies fragment and keep evolving, across channels

//ST: !

Browsers, Cookies, APIs, mobile OS (Android or iOS?), etc... All these different techs evolve and need continuous effort and expertise to integrate.

//ST: !

Example: *did you notice* that on a mobile device, the url of the pages you visit can now start with an https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/whats-in-an-amp-url/[AMP url]?

Like, to visit the page of the New York Times the url should be http://www.nyt.com but it looks like: *http://google.com/amp/www.nyt.com*

This *http://google.com/amp* prefix is a new tech by Google to accelerate the display of web pages on mobiles. Fine.
But then, as a marketing data analyst, how to count visits to:

//ST: !

http://google.com/amp/www.nyt.com

and

http://www.nyt.com/etc

-> It is important to count visits to these two urls as a visit *to the same page*.

//ST: !

In Sept 2017 major services of web data analytics were http://searchengineland.com/google-amp-cache-unified-users-analytics-282069[still struggling with this issue].

This illustrates that to just count visits to a web page (something which should be classic and robust) and integrate this data to a larger analysis, big issues can arise and be hard to fix even in 2017, because of the evolution of techs and standards.

//ST: !

==== d. In the meantime, customers have growing expectations about the quality of service

//ST: !

Difficulties posed by data integration do not slow or decrease customers expectations.
To the contrary, we see an elevation of expectations.
Customers increasingly expect:

- realtime contact
- two-ways interaction (they want to be able to voice their opinion, and get a response)
- seamless experience (no glitch, modern UI, consistence of the UX across channels)
- personalized experience (customization of the message they receive)

//ST: !

==== e. Example: A French bank going through the 2010s

== 3. Tools for data integration: DMPs and more
//ST: 3. Tools for data integration: DMPs and more


==== a. Data Management Platform (DMP)

//ST: !

In 2015/2016 a new acronym started to trend: "DMP", standing for *"Data Management Platform"*.

Basically a DMP is an information system dedicated to solving the issues of data integration:

//ST: !

- it can store a large amount of data
- it can receive data from a variety of sources, in a variety of formats

//ST: !

- it offers functions to reconcile records from different data sources and generate a unique identifier for each reconciled entry.
- it offers segmentation / classification functions

//ST: !

- it provides security and analytics capabilities on the data
- it makes this data available for execution by other software.


//ST: !
==== b. DMP in relation to other information systems

//ST: !

DMPs are relatively new. They integrate with 3 other information systems in the firm:

//ST: !

- CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
** This is the software *gathering* data related to customers and sales. It is a major source of *input data* for a DMP.

//ST: !

- ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
** Large software synchronizing information systems from finance, sales, logistics and more. The CRM can be independent or part of the ERP.

//ST: !

- DSP (Demand Side Platform)
** https://digiday.com/media/wtf-demand-side-platform/[piece of software automatizing ad buying]. So, the audiences identified in the DMP could be served corresponding ads automatically with a DSP.


//ST: !
How can data circulate across these software and with the external world? The next lesson is devoted to APIs, another important concept.
