== 1. Definitions
A network is a dataset made of entities [underline]#and their relations#

Scientists use the term "graph" to discuss networks.

=== a. Social networks

(((social network)))

//+
As users, we are very familiar with one type of networks - social networks:

image:weibo.png[width=150]
image:instagram.jpg[width=150]

=== b. Other networks
It is important to realize that networks cover more than relations between humans.
For example, it is possible to imagine a network made out of cooking recipes.
2 ingredients are connected if they appear frequently in the same recipes.

Scanning all recipes and their ingredients from a website of cooking recipes, this gives:

//+
Semantic networks are another broad category of networks.
The method is the same: we need to find a way to "relate" words in a text, then we get a network.
//+
The general idea is the same as in cooking recipes: 2 terms of a text will be connected in the network if they frequently appeared in same paragraphs.

=== c. How big can networks be?
With a surge in computing power in the age of big data, and the adequate NOSQL databases (such as https://neo4j.com/[Neo4J] or http://orientdb.com/orientdb/[OrientDB]), we can deal with huge networks:

//+
For example, https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/anatomy-of-facebook/10150388519243859/[“The Anatomy of the Facebook Social Graph” (2011)]

-> study of 721 million active Facebook users and the 69 billion (!) friendship links connecting them.

//+
A limit is quickly reached in terms of visualization: it is hard to fit millions of nodes on a screen.
In the next visualization, we can see a network of 90,000 Swedish speakers and their relations on Twitter. The view is very cluttered.

=== d. How to discuss networks? Some vocabulary

== 2. Networks: what use for business?
=== a. Segmentation
(((segmentation)))

If a network is made of entities and their relations, then a segment is a subgroup of entities in the network, which has some cohesion or something in common.

This subgroup of nodes in the network is often called a "*community*".

//+
Detecting communities in a network, also called "clustering", consists in finding nodes that have many connections in common.

//+
This is a mathematical and algorithmic procedure, but it is very simple to understand visually:

=== b. Finding key players

=== c. Understanding how information spreads

A data science company created "Where does my tweet go", which traces how a given tweet spreads through retweets.
//+
The service is now discontinued (Twitter datan was too expensive to buy) but the mechanism can be explained:

=== d. Identifying patterns - for fraud detection, control or intelligence.

(((fraud detection)))

//+
In the following video, we see https://www.dnb.nl/en/binaries/Working%20Paper%20418_tcm47-305800.pdf[participants in the money market (short term loans between banks) in Europe].
//+
2 banks are connected if one lends to the other. The pattern of exchanges shifts through years - banks withdraw from the market.

Another example: connecting seemingly unrelated measures of business performance with https://www.oracle.com/solutions/business-analytics/business-intelligence/index.html[Oracle BI] and https://linkurio.us/[Linkurious]:
